# ⚡ Final Project: Swissgrid Single-Price Mechanism 

My **final project** analyzes whether **keeping open positions** in the intraday market could be **profitable** under the new single-price mechanism starting in 2026. 📊💡

The European grid runs at **50 Hz** ⚡. Frequency varies with **production vs. consumption**:

* Production > Consumption → frequency rises 📈
* Consumption > Production → frequency falls 📉

**Swissgrid** stabilizes the grid using **ancillary services**. Balance groups are:

* 💰 Compensated for helping balance the grid
* ⚠️ Penalized for causing imbalances

From 2026:

* PSA will be removed 🔄
* Incentives to keep open positions will rise ✅

This project evaluates if this change could **generate additional profits**. 🚀
